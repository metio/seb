Compared to gpg it is much simpler by focusing on the encryption parts only.
Add the following snippet to your .chezmoi.toml to configure chezmoi to use age:
encryption = &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; [age] identity = &amp;#34;path/to/age/private-key&amp;#34; recipient = &amp;#34;age...public...key...&amp;#34; Adding files to your chezmoi source directory remains the same as compared to using gpg - just call chezmoi add --encrypt path/to/file.</description></item><item><title>Encrypt dotfiles with chezmoi</title><link>https://seb.xn--ho-hia.de/posts/chezmoi-gpg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://seb.xn--ho-hia.de/posts/chezmoi-gpg/</guid><description>RECOMMENDATION: Use age instead of gpg.
chezmoi can use various external tools to keep data private. gpg is used by various other tools as well, so chances are that you already have a functional setup on your system. To configure gpg with chezmoi, just set yourself as the recipient like this:
[gpg] recipient = &amp;#34;your.name@example.com&amp;#34; Calling chezmoi add --encrypt /path/to/secret will now create encrypt the file with your public key which allows you to decrypt them later with your private key.</description></item></channel></rss>
